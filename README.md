# cnn-image-generator
This project demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to generate new images by learning features from an image dataset. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on image data to reconstruct and generate similar images, showcasing the ability of CNNs to understand and replicate visual patterns.
